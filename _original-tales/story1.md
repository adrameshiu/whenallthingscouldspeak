All communities have various legends or myths which circulate throughout the teenage culture, and my hometown is no exception. Indianapolis is the twelfth largest city in the United States, so consequently many different legends and variations of legends pass from one high school to another. Stories are often told about the eerie effect of the screaming bridge on the far westside and of the antics of a headless driver who frequents the country roads near Geist Reservoir, but by far the most popular legend told is “The House of Blue Lights.”

“The House of Blue Lights” is located on a tract of wooded property at the intersection of Fall Creek Parkway and State Road 100. A tall electrically charged fence surrounded the property and large St. Bernard dogs roamed and patrolled the fenced-in area. Curiosity dared adventuresome teenagers and pre-teens to investigate what strange phenomena may lie behind the challenging barrier. To further add to the mysteriousness, an eccentric and extravagant old man lived with this almost impregnable private fortress.

The man’s name was Skiles Test. He had had a humble start as a pig farmer at the beginning of the depression, however a few wise investments had made him one of the wealthiest landowners in the Indianapolis area. Probably as early as 1940, various stories and rumors began to circulate. Some classmates of mine say that even their parents tell tales of this magnificent home that was hidden deep within the woods. At first the stories were only about the beautiful patios and swimming pool that were adjacent to the splendid white marble house. The neatly kept gardens and hedges were the topic of all of the local gardeners. Test was extremely well-liked by his friends and family, and he had a reputation for showing generosity and understanding towards his friends and employees. But, with the death of his wife, the turning point of the legend began.

It seems that Test almost completely withdrew from society after his wife died. About the only people he had any contact with at all were his servants and maids. He made it more and more obvious that he wanted almost complete isolation. His personality was quickly taking the shape of a hermit - mad and bitter at the whole world. His privacy and secrecy led to much talk and speculation from outsiders. The stories grew and the legend, as I know it today, began to unfold.

<p>
Immediately after his wife’s death, Test had blue lightbulbs installed in every light socket throughout the estate, supposedly because blue was her favorite color. Even the swimming pool was illuminated with those blue lights. The reflections of the blue lights off of the white marble house caused the glow which was visible from the nearby roads. Rumors stated that he had had his wife’s body encased in a glass coffin, which, in turn, was standing in a corner of one of the parlors. Test allegedly went through the same ritual of kissing his wife good-night and “tucking her into bed” each and every night. There was also much bewilderment at the cat graveyard behind the house, which contained over 120 tombstones. People who had dared to take the risk of being shot at by venturing within the fence, told about isolated little cottages which were theoretically supposed to have mistresses at one time or another. Then, in 1966, Test died and a front-page newspaper article gave an already well-known legend even more publicity.

The article exposed all of the already mentioned legends, plus some other fascinating facts. It describes how Test, whenever he bought anything, purchased a whole train boxcar load and stored them in his basement. He had done this with shoes, ketchup, various canned fruits, and mock turtle soup - a discontinued delicacy of which he was very fond. It also explained how Test was an avid collector of antiques and announced an auction where all of those were to be sold. The article went on to state that Test actually had two wives, without ever applying for a divorce, one of which was still living in California with their son. This aroused much curiosity as to how he had kept the second wife a secret for such a long time and helped to validate the theory that he actually had had many mistresses and possibly even other wives.

For the next three or four years, a great invasion took place on the property, not only by curiosity seekers, but also by vandals. Because of the acts of vandalism, police patrols were stepped-up, which made a trip to “The House of Blue Lights” even more daring and exciting for high schoolers in the area. The legend continued to thrive and everyone knew the bizarre story behind it. The property has now been purchased by the Federal Interstate System, and much of the old estate has been wrecked in order to make way for progress. However, the legend still prospers, even with what little of the property remains untouched.

Last summer, i became good friends with an interesting individual, Paul Rodgers, who is currently a freshman here at I.U. The ironic part of this acquaintance is that Pual lives with his grandmother in what remains of “The House of Blue Lights.” His grandmother is currently groundskeeper, and she had been an employee of Skiles Test for many years. Paul’s father had even done odd jobs for Test when had been a young boy. Paul is probably the foremost authority on “The House of Blue Lights” and he asserts that, with the exception of the glass coffin, all of the different rumors and stories are actually true. Paul has shown me all around the legendary estate, and I can understand, with his descriptions, why “The House of Blue Lights” has become a legend. He has made it particularly clear why it has become a legend, even before the mysterious tales, which followed the death of Test’s wife. “The House of Blue Lights” is surely a legend that will be forever perpetuated through the years.

## Once upon a time,

<div class="story-text"  data-scroll data-scroll-speed="-1" data-scroll-delay="0.6" data-scroll-direction="vertical">
    <p>
    there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other. "That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take.
